# Student Data Analysis

Student Data Analysis is a python data analysis service that runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on heroku. 
This has been specifically built for admin at secondary schools so that they may easily find data about students, such as lists of students in certain clubs.
Users are also able to quickly add new students to the Google Sheet through the use of the python terminal.
